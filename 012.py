# The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. 
# So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28.
# We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.
# What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
